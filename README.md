# akasha-events

Akasha Events is the canonical **event schema and persistent ledger layer** for the Akasha ecosystem.

Everything that happens in Akasha — human observations, API data, sensor readings,
and future discovery outputs — is represented as an **Event**.

## V2 goal

V2 turns `akasha-events` from a schema-only seed into a **working event ledger**.

It now includes:

- canonical event schema
- SQLite storage
- event insert helpers
- simple event query helpers
- CLI for add/list/recent

## Why it matters

Without a durable event ledger, Akasha has no memory.

Akasha Events is the first persistent place where:

- enriched observations
- machine observations
- external observations

can accumulate in a common structure and later be queried for patterns.

## Example event

```json
{
  "event_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-30T20:00:00Z",
  "location": "38.42,-82.44",
  "category": "observation",
  "source": "human",
  "payload": {
    "title": "strange lights",
    "notes": "three flashes near tree line"
  },
  "confidence": 0.72
}
```
